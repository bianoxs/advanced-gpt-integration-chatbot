# Advanced Discord chatbot with GPT-3 Integration

_This README was partially written with the help of GPT-3._

The program is a Discord bot that takes advantage of the [chatgpt library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) to integrate GPT-3 capabilities into Discord chats. This allows users to communicate with the bot and get real-time responses generated by GPT-3.
